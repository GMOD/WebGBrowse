 WebGBrowse Installation
-------------------------

WebGBrowse 2.0 is tested on Linux OS. It requires GBrowse 1.70 or GBrowse 2.0 preinstalled. Even though WebGBrowse 2.0 is designed so as to support both versions of GBrowse simultaneously, the user can pick either of the two versions. When both the versions are installed together, WebGBrowse can be useful in upgrading the GBrowse configuration files from 1.70 to 2.0 or vice versa. The installation instructions and the software download links for GBrowse can be found at http://gmod.org/wiki/Gbrowse.

I. Prerequisites

	- GBrowse (>= 1.70)
	- MySQL
	- Perl Modules
		HTML::FormEngine
		Clone

		Archive::Extract
		File::Copy
		File::Basename

II. Installation 

	1. Install GBrowse x.x
		For details on installing GBrowse, please visit http://gmod.org/wiki/Gbrowse


	You must have already completed Step 2, otherwise you wouldn't be reading this document. You may proceed to Step 3.

	2. Download the webgbrowse archive (http://webgbrowse.cgb.indiana.edu/webgbrowse/gmod-WebGBrowse.tar.gz) and extract the files into a separate directory.

		wget http://webgbrowse.cgb.indiana.edu/gmod-WebGBrowse.tar.gz
		tar -xvf gmod-WebGBrowse.tar.gz


						Or

	
	   Checkout a copy from https://gmod.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gmod/WebGBrowse into a folder by name WebGBrowse.
	
		svn co https://gmod.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gmod/WebGBrowse WebGBrowse
	
	
	   All the extracted source files will be in a folder named "WebGBrowse".


	3. Locate the cgi-bin directory for your apache instance and create a folder by name 'webgbrowse' in it.
	
	4. Copy the contents of WebGBrowse/src/v01/webgb_cgiscripts into the 'cgi-bin/webgbrowse' folder created in step 3.

	5. Locate the htdocs directory for your apache instance and create a folder by name 'webgbrowse' in it.
	
	6. Copy the contents of WebGBrowse/src/v01/webgb_pages into the 'htdocs/webgbrowse' folder created in step 5.

	5. Create a folder by name "lib" in the parent directory of the cgi-bin and copy the contents of WebGBrowse/src/v01/webgb_libraries into it.

	6. Create a folder by name "files" in the parent directory of the cgi-bin and copy the contents of WebGBrowse/src/v01/webgb_files into it.

	7. Finally create a folder by name "tmp" in the parent directory of the cgi-bin.

	8. Open the lib/WebGB.pm file and set the values for the variables under the comment "Server Settings" (Lines 27 to 34).


				Line 27: List the GBrowse versions you have installed (1.70 or 2.0 or both)
				our @GBR_VER = ("1.70", "2.0"); 

				Line 28: This will be the path to the "tmp" folder you created in Step. 7
				our $TMP = 'path/to/tmp';

				Line 29: This will be the path to "yamlib" folder copied into the "files" folder in Step. 6
				our $YAML_LIB = 'path/to/files/yamlib';

				Line 30: This will be the path to your sendmail program
				our $SEND_MAIL = '/usr/sbin/sendmail';

				Line 31: This will be the path to the "conf" directory of GBrowse 1.70 installation. If GBrowse 1.70 is not installed, leave it empty.
				our $CONF = 'path/to/gbrowse/conf';

				Line 32: This will be the path to the htdocs directory for your apache instance (see Step. 4). This variable needs to be set even if GBrowse 2.0 is the only version of GBrowse that is installed.
				our $WWW = 'path/to/htdocs';

				Line 33: This will be the path to the htdocs directory for the apache instance under which GBrowse 2.0 runs. If GBrowse 2.0 is not installed, leave it empty.
				our $WWW2 = 'path/to/htdocs2';

				If GBrowse 2.0 is the only GBrowse installation you have, $WWW2 (Line 33) will be same as $WWW (Line 32).

				Line 34: This will be the path to the "conf" directory of GBrowse 2.0 installation. If GBrowse 2.0 is not installed, leave it empty.
				our $CONF2 = 'path/to/gbrowse2_conf';


	9. Install MySQL if you haven't already done so.

	10. Create a database by name WebGB.

	11. Create a table WebGB_DataSets

		CREATE TABLE WebGB_DataSets ( 
			ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
			EMail CHAR(32) NOT NULL, 
			Created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(), 
			TSD CHAR(32) NOT NULL, 
			Description TEXT NOT NULL, 
			PRIMARY KEY (ID) 
		);

	12. Open the lib/WebGB/DBEngine.pm and edit the line 47 to provide the username and password for the mysql WebGB database.

III. Testing the Installation (Optional)

	You can test the installation by running the sample dataset. You should be able to complete all the steps described below without any problems, if WebGBrowse is properly installed.

	1. Open a browser (preferrably Firefox 3.0 or above) and go to "http://myserver/webgbrowse/" (replace 'myserver' with the name of your server). This should open WebGBrowse startup page.
	
	2. Click the link "Sample GFF3 file" to download the "volvox.gff3" file.

	3. Click the link "Sample Conf file" to download the "volvox.conf" file.

	4. Click the "Browse..." button in the "GFF3 File" section of the WebGBrowse Input Form and select the file, volvox.gff3, you downloaded in Step 2.

	5. Click the "Browse..." button in the "Configuration file to be used as template" section of the WebGBrowse Input Form and select the file, volvox.conf, you downloaded in Step 3.

	6. Click Submit and you will see a new screen with three sections "Describe Your Dataset", "Add New Track" and "Tracks Added".

	7. Click the button "Display in GBrowse x.x" in the "Tracks Added" section (x.x will be the version number of GBrowse).

	8. You should be taken to the GBrowse display page showing data from volvox.gff3 as tracks defined in volvox.conf. This should confirm your installation.
